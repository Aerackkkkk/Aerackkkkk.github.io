            <p>Hello, my name is <strong>ANJAL THAPA</strong>, and I'm a student. While I may not have a lot of
                experience or skills yet, I'm eager to learn and grow in my field. I'm a hard worker and a quick
                learner, and I'm excited to take on new challenges. I'm committed to building my expertise and
                developing my abilities so that I can become a valuable asset to any team or project. Thank you for
                taking the time to learn a little bit about me, and I hope to have the opportunity to work with you in
                the future.</p>
